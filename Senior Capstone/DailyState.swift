        // could we have something in the AppDelegate file where when the app is first launched, it checks to see if Date enity holds the current date, and if not it updates the current date?

    // initilize state with Core Data based on current date when app is launched
        // Date enity will need to be created and pre-initialized

    // reinitialize state with Core Data if a different date is chosen
        // might just be done in settings, not sure what is best yet

    // update the state any time the Core Database is written too
        // when we add food items, we might want to update servings for a partcular food group
        // also not sure yet how this will look, or if it goes here
